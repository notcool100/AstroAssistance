# AstroAssistance AI Training Guide

This guide explains how to train and maintain the AI models that power AstroAssistance's intelligent features.

## Overview of AI Components

AstroAssistance uses multiple machine learning models to provide intelligent assistance:

1. **Task Completion Predictor**: Predicts whether a task will be completed on time
2. **Task Duration Predictor**: Predicts how long a task will actually take to complete
3. **Recommendation Engine**: Generates personalized recommendations based on predictions and user behavior

## Training Options

### Option 1: Manual Training

Run the training script manually when you want to update the models:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
cd /path/to/AstroAssistance
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the training script
./train_models.py --generate-recommendations
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the available task data
- Train the task completion prediction model
- Train the task duration prediction model
- Generate new recommendations based on the trained models
- Save all models and recommendations to the appropriate directories

### Option 2: Scheduled Training (Recommended for Production)

Set up automatic scheduled training to keep the models up-to-date:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
cd /path/to/AstroAssistance
source venv/bin/activate

# Set up a cron job for daily training at 2 AM
./schedule_training.py --setup-cron
```

You can also run the scheduled training manually:

```bash
./schedule_training.py --run-training
```

## Training Data

The AI models are trained using:

1. **Historical Task Data**: Completed tasks with actual durations
2. **User Behavior Data**: How users interact with tasks and recommendations
3. **Synthetic Data**: Generated data to supplement real data during initial deployment

As users interact with the system, it collects more data and improves over time.

## Model Evaluation

The training process includes evaluation metrics:

- **Task Completion Predictor**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
- **Task Duration Predictor**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

These metrics are logged during training and can be reviewed to monitor model performance.

## Continuous Learning

AstroAssistance implements continuous learning through:

1. **Feedback Collection**: User interactions and task completions provide feedback
2. **Periodic Retraining**: Models are retrained on a schedule with new data
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Model metrics are tracked over time

## Customizing the Training Process

You can customize the training process by modifying:

- **train_models.py**: The main training script
- **schedule_training.py**: The scheduling configuration

Advanced customization options include:

- Adjusting model hyperparameters
- Adding new features to the models
- Implementing different ML algorithms
- Customizing the recommendation generation logic

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Data**:
   - Error: "Not enough data for training"
   - Solution: Generate more synthetic data or wait until more user data is collected

2. **Model Performance Issues**:
   - Symptom: Low accuracy or high error rates
   - Solution: Review the training data quality, adjust model parameters, or consider more complex models

3. **Scheduling Problems**:
   - Symptom: Scheduled training not running
   - Solution: Check cron configuration and log files in the logs directory

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Review training logs and model performance metrics regularly
2. **Data Quality**: Ensure the data used for training is clean and representative
3. **Gradual Deployment**: Test new models in a staging environment before production
4. **Feedback Loop**: Implement mechanisms to collect user feedback on recommendations

## Advanced Topics

### A/B Testing

To evaluate new model versions:

1. Deploy the new model to a subset of users
2. Compare performance metrics between user groups
3. Roll out the better-performing model to all users

### Transfer Learning

For faster model development:

1. Start with pre-trained models when available
2. Fine-tune on your specific task data
3. Periodically update the base models

### Explainable AI

To understand model decisions:

1. Use model-specific explanation techniques (e.g., SHAP values)
2. Provide explanations alongside recommendations
3. Track which explanations lead to higher user acceptance

## Conclusion

The AI training system is designed to improve over time as more data is collected. Regular training ensures that the models stay up-to-date with changing user behavior and task patterns.
