# AstroAssistance: Self-Learning AI Productivity Assistant

AstroAssistance is a comprehensive AI productivity assistant that learns and adapts to your work patterns, preferences, and goals. Unlike traditional productivity tools, AstroAssistance continuously improves through reinforcement learning and user feedback, providing increasingly personalized recommendations over time.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, organize, and track tasks with intelligent prioritization
- **Smart Scheduling**: Optimize your calendar based on your productivity patterns
- **Goal Tracking**: Set and monitor progress on short and long-term goals
- **Adaptive Recommendations**: Receive personalized suggestions that improve over time
- **Continuous Learning**: The system learns from your feedback and behavior
- **Self-Improvement**: Models retrain automatically to enhance performance

## Architecture

AstroAssistance is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and enables continuous improvement:

- **Core**: Base classes, data types, configuration, and logging
- **Data Processing**: Data generation, preprocessing, and feature engineering
- **Models**: Neural networks and reinforcement learning models
- **Training**: Model training and evaluation pipelines
- **API**: RESTful API for client applications
- **UI**: User interface components (to be implemented)

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **FastAPI**: API framework
- **Stable-Baselines3**: Reinforcement learning library
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data processing
- **MLflow/Weights & Biases**: Experiment tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AstroAssistance.git
   cd AstroAssistance
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Generate synthetic data:
   ```bash
   python main.py generate-data
   ```

4. Process data:
   ```bash
   python main.py process-data
   ```

5. Train models:
   ```bash
   python main.py train
   ```

6. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   python main.py api
   ```

## Usage

### API Endpoints

The API provides the following main endpoints:

- `/tasks`: Manage tasks
- `/reminders`: Manage reminders
- `/goals`: Manage goals
- `/preferences`: Manage user preferences
- `/recommendations`: Get and provide feedback on recommendations

For detailed API documentation, visit `/docs` when the API server is running.

### Example: Creating a Task

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/tasks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Complete project proposal",
    "description": "Finish the draft and send for review",
    "category": "work",
    "priority": "high",
    "due_date": "2023-06-15T17:00:00Z",
    "estimated_duration": 120,
    "tags": ["project", "proposal"]
  }'
```

### Example: Getting Recommendations

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/recommendations/generate?count=3" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Model Training

AstroAssistance includes three main types of models:

1. **Task Completion Model**: Predicts the likelihood of completing tasks based on their attributes
2. **Recommendation Model**: Generates personalized recommendations based on user data
3. **Reinforcement Learning Model**: Continuously improves recommendation quality based on feedback

To train specific models:

```bash
# Train all models
python main.py train

# Train only the task completion model
python main.py train --model task

# Train with experiment tracking
python main.py train --wandb
```

## Continuous Learning

AstroAssistance implements continuous learning through:

1. **User Feedback Loop**: Explicit feedback on recommendations
2. **Activity Monitoring**: Implicit feedback from user actions
3. **Periodic Retraining**: Models are retrained with new data
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: The system learns optimal recommendation strategies
